### What I learned

Nothing special, this project was very easy for me

### Continued development

am currently focused on advancing my skills in both frontend and backend development. On the frontend side, I am exploring modern frameworks and libraries such as React, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Ant Design to build responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

For backend development, I am working with technologies including Express.js, Next.js, Prisma, MySQL, and TypeScript to gain a deeper understanding of server-side logic, APIs, and database management.

My goal is to become a well-rounded developer by continuously learning and applying these tools in real-world projects.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is my favorite documentation platform I've been using since I started programming, it's the best explained resource.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is also my favorite documentation platform, which I've been using a lot lately.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I'm always looking for news and listening to other developers, sharing their experiences so that I can see many different solutions to a problem.
